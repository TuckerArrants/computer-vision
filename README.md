# Training on TPU with Flower Classification

Here you will find two notebooks that use TPUs and transfer learning to perform image classifications problems. The melanoma notebook is part of a current Kaggle competition, so I am only sharing so much, but it is clear how one would take these two processes in these notebooks and make a single model that is diverse enough to be applied to both of these problems with a simple change of parameters.

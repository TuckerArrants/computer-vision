# Training on TPU with Flower Classification

In this Google Colab notebook, I fine-tuned deep CNNs with selective learning rate schedules to classify images as 104 different types of flowers. The training and test sets comprised over 5GB of data, so I used Tensor Processing Units on to perform image augmentation, KFold validation training, and prediction blending
